## Training

All the training was performed on Google Colab, and the final model was saved and downloaded for gradCAM++ implementation. I would recommend doing the same if you would like to train the model on new data. I have included the main.ipynb for ease of use. Obviously, you would have to specify different file paths, but the hyper-parameters should be optimal
