## Training

All the training was performed on Google Colab, and the final model was saved and downloaded for gradCAM++ implementation. I would recommend doing the same if you would like to train the model on new data. I have included the main.ipynb for ease of use. Obviously, you would have to specify different file paths, but the hyper-parameters should be optimal

I have created this repo to make the code cleaner and easier to understand, however, as specified all the original training and testing code is within main.ipynb. It is a collection of different techniques to train and test data, so may be hectic. This repo tries to clean it up and show my thoughts in a more organised manner.
